## Task

Your task is to go through the routes provided, identify any issues, and fix them. You should also add any additional features you think are necessary. Adding tests is a plus.

The files in src/data are the mocked out data stores that the API uses. These are the only files which SHOULD NOT be modified. Feel free to read through their code to get an idea of what they are doing if needed.

Feel free to add any dependencies you think are necessary.

If there are improvements you'd like to make that are to time consuming, add a comment in the code explaining what you would do. Add any other recommendations or potential future improvements in the README.

## Additional Task

If you have time, create a new endpoint similar to `/top-user-stats`, which would power a new page showing the top 50 users.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. The API will be running on `http://localhost:3001`

## Submission

Once you are happy with your changes, push them to a new github repo and send us the link.
